Minio Cloud Foundry Adapter
===========================

Minio On-Demand-Broker service adapter for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

The service-adapter tool should be packaged as a BOSH package and then bundled with the
Minio Tile. The ODB process will call the service-adapter tool to generate the YAML
manifest, which is then used by CF to deploy the minio instance.

Instructions to build BOSH package
----------------------------------

If any bug is fixed in `src/service-adapter`, the following steps should be used to build
the BOSH package:

* `cd src/service-adapter/`
* `go build` # builds service-adapter tool
* `cd ../..`
* `bosh add-blob src/service-adapter/service-adapter service-adapter`
* `bosh create-release --final --force` # creates bosh release which can be used with Tile
*  Add any release yaml files generated by `bosh create-release`
